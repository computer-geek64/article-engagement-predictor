<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction:</h1>
<p>The New York Times is an American newspaper that is widely regarded as one of the popular and well-established news sources in the world. Over the past few years, user engagement has steadily grown leading to stronger online opinions as well as the need to classify and measure the sort of engagement on articles. By predicting the public response, the newspaper can give more targeted articles which will draw in more readers and keep the public well informed and engaged about critical current events in the world. To do so, we will use an open-source dataset of 16,000 New York Times articles and 5 million corresponding comments, with over 30 features to examine.</p>

<a id="problem-definition" class="anchor" href="#problem-definition" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Definition:</h1>
<p>Given various features of a New York Times article as inputs, the goal of our project is to generate an overall <strong>engagement metric</strong>. This engagement metric can provide editors with necessary insight and feedback on their writing to gauge the audience reaction before they publicly publish their article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article Features: headline, article newsdesk, article section, article length, keywords, abstract, etc</li>
<li>Output of the first model: Number of comments for the article</li>
<li>Output of the second model: Forecasted average sentiment magnitude</li>
<li>Final output: Engagement metric (calculated through a weighted sum of the number of comments and the magnitude of the sentiment that the article is forecasted to receive)</li>
</ul>

<a id="methods" class="anchor" href="#methods" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methods:</h1>
<p><strong>Pre-processing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate rows that lack data for each feature (this is invalid data and should be discarded)</li>
<li>Use a sentiment analysis natural language processing model to create an additional average sentiment magnitude column on the articles dataset for all of the corresponding columns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Machine learning models used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two NLP models will be used (one model for prediction of the number of comments, one model for the average sentiment magnitude of the comments)
<ul>
<li>Sentiment magnitude prediction uses the column we created in the preprocessing step</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of comments and average sentiment magnitude are directly correlated to levels of user engagement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post-processing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of comments and average sentiment magnitude can be combined into a final engagement metric through a mathematical formula</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a id="potential-results" class="anchor" href="#potential-results" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Potential Results:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Number of comments that a potential published article could receive as well as the general sentiment towards that topic
<ul>
<li>These values could be combined to create an overall engagement metric that determines the strength of interactions that an article could generate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Classified groupings into different classes of articles based on topics</li>
<li>A model with the ability to predict the number of comments for a given article with certain input features</li>
</ul>

<a id="discussion" class="anchor" href="#discussion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Discussion:</h1>
<p>By analyzing and predicting the number of comments anticipated for a given article, the publishers can determine the level of public interest in a given topic and can choose to follow up with corresponding related articles. In addition, the sentiment analysis will allow the editors to determine how polarizing an article is, and potentially provide items such as blog posts to provide a forum for further public discussion. If an article shows low sentiment, then the publishers can decide whether it is worthwhile to publish the article or possibly fine-tune it to keep readers more engaged.</p>
